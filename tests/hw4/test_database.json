  "description": "This tests whether the database search and matching is working correctly. Note that some time representations ('after 3pm', 'lunch', 'morning' etc.) may differ slightly. If the 3rd lookup result is 0 and 4th is correct, it means just that the system is case-sensitive. If the 3rd & 4th results are 64, it's actually better (over-midnight trains are not ignored)",
